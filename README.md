## üìÇ Project Structure

### HTML (`index.html`)
Defines the structure of the webpage, including input fields, dropdowns, and result display.

### CSS (`style.css`)
Handles the styling, ensuring the application is visually appealing and mobile-responsive.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
Contains the core logic for encryption and decryption using placeholder implementations of common algorithms.

##How It Works
Input Handling:

Users provide plain text or encrypted text in the input box.
Dropdowns allow algorithm and mode selection.
Encryption/Decryption Logic:

The JavaScript file (script.js) processes the text.
Placeholder implementations of AES, RSA, DES, and Fernet are used for demonstration purposes.
Output:

The processed result (encrypted or decrypted text) is displayed in real-time.

##üõ°Ô∏è Disclaimer
This tool uses placeholder encryption methods (Base64 encoding for simplicity). It is not suitable for securing sensitive data in production. For real-world applications, always use robust cryptographic libraries and follow security best practices.

---

##üí° Future Enhancements
Implement real cryptographic libraries (e.g., CryptoJS or Web Crypto API).
Add support for user-defined encryption keys.
Save and load encrypted files.
Include additional encryption algorithms (e.g., Blowfish, Twofish).
